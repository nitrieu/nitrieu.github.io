I am an Assistant Professor of computer science at <a href="https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/3720292" style="color:blue; text-decoration: none"> Arizona State University</a>. My research interests are in the area of cryptography and security, with a specific focus on <b>secure computation</b> and its applications such as private set intersection, private database queries, and privacy-preserving machine learning.

Before  joining  ASU,  I was a postdoc at <a href="https://berkeley.edu/" style="color:blue; text-decoration: none"> UC Berkeley</a>  under the mentorship of <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/" style="color:blue; text-decoration: none">Prof. Dawn Song</a>. I received my PhD and Master's degrees from <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/" style="color:blue; text-decoration: none">Oregon State University</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/" target="_blank" style="color:blue; text-decoration: none">Prof. Mike Rosulek</a> (big shout-out to Mike, who brought me to the field of crypto!). During my graduate studies, I spent several summers as a research intern at  <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/" style="color:blue; text-decoration: none">Bell Labs</a>, <a href="https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research.html" style="color:blue; text-decoration: none">Visa Research</a>, and <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/" style="color:blue; text-decoration: none">Google</a>. I got a B.S. degree from <a href="http://english.spbstu.ru" style="color:blue; text-decoration: none">St.Petersburg State Polytechnic University</a>.
